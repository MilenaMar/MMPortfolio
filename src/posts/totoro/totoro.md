Game developed during the third week of the Ironhack Bootcamp for Web Development.


Javascript, P5 Library, HTML, DOM Manipulation and CSS.



Game built using JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming, Collision checks, Frame Counts, speeds and
timers.


Studio Ghibli Movies are simple the best!, and My Neighbour Totoro is my personal favorite.
Why not bring together the two things that I love! Coding & Totoro.
